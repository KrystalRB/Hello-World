# Hello-World

Hey! It's me, Krystal.

I am 15 years old, and have had a passion for computer science and music since a very young age.
I'm currently a student at Fern Creek High School, but will soon be moving to Florida. Despite this, I'll still be participating in Fern Creek's "Women Who Code" club.
